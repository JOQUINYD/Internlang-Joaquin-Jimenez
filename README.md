## General structure ##

The general structure of the system consists of three main packages:
1. Compiler
2. CodeGenerator
3. UIGenerator



### Compiler Structure ###

There is a class compiler, which is responsible for compiling any given code in a specific language. It must follow a step-by-step process until it has the necessary information to generate new code. We use the method: compile(code, targetCode), where code is the input code, and targetCode is an ENUM specifying the language in which we want the output code. 

The first step in this process is the lexical analysis of the input code. We have a Lexer class responsible for creating an ArrayList of Tokens. A token is a class.

The second step is syntax analysis. We have a Parser class. We use the ArrayList of Tokens generated by the Lexer to construct the SymbolTable and ParseTree. The SymbolTable and ParseTree are classes.

The third step is semantic analysis. We have a SemanticAnalyzer class, that uses the SymbolTable and ParseTree generated by the Parse and verify that it is correct.

The final step is generating the code with a CodeGenerator.

The file "Internlag UML.pdf" is an UML diagram that helps visualizing the structure of the system.


### Code generation structure ###

We have a general CodeGenerator Interface that each specific CodeGenerator will implement. Thus, all specific CodeGenerators need to implement the methods stated in the Interface. 

The method generate(ParseTree, SymbolTree) will generate the code for its specific language and returns it as a String, based on the information passed through the SymbolTable and ParseTree defined in the previous steps.

For this initial structure, I defined four specific CodeGenerators:
* PythonCodeGenerator
* JavaCodeGenerator
* CsharpCodeGenerator
* TypescriptCodeGenerator.

Each has an UIGenerator, which will generate UI elements based on its language libraries.


### UI elements generation structure ###

All UIGenerators need to implement the UIGenerator Interface. Here we define the methods to create UI elements. For example, createButton() or createWindow().
 
Each language has its own UIGenerator: 
* PythonUIGenerator
* JavaUIGenerator
* CsharpUIGenerator
* TypescriptUIGenerator

All UI elements will implement the Interface UIElement. Each element, for example, UIButton and UIWindow, will extend from UIElement.

We need to define specific UIElements for each language. In the case of UIButton and UIWindow, each language must have its own Button and Window class. For example, Python will have a PythonButton class and PythonWindow class.

A CodeGenerator has an UIGenerator specific for its language. For example, the PythonCodeGenerator has an UIGenerator such as uiGenerator = new PythonUIGenerator. Since all specific UIGenerators are UIGenerators, we can create UIElements using the same methods; However, these methods will behave differently for each language.
